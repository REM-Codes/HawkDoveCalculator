# HawkDoveCalculator
## Summary
This is a simple program that compiles all of the hawk-dove information from Richard Dawkins' *The Selfish Gene* into an easy-to-use calculator. 
Instead of crunching the numbers to calculate a hawk-dove ESS, the program calculates it for you.

The default values for `WinPayoff`, `LosePayoff`, `InjuryPayoff`, and `WasteTimePayoff` are the arbitrary values defined in *The Selfish Gene*. 

## Usage
To use, download, extract, and run the C# code, or access it in the web [here](https://replit.com/@REMCodes/HawkDoveCalculator#main.cs) (link to repl.it).

The variables to edit are all at the very top.

## Contribute
This was made as a side project for my schooling, and I decided to publish it online. If you encounter a problem, feel free to open an issue, or try to fix it yourself and open a pull request.

This was not designed to be a fully-fledged calculator, it was purely to further my understanding of the equations and calculations that Richard Dawkins introduced to me.

If you would like to fork the project and add features or optimize it, please feel free to do so. All I ask is that you credit me and/or link to this page. 

If an official license should become necessary, I will select a predefined one (or write it myself) at a later date.

## Going further
As I stated above, I wrote this as a fun little experiment. I might convert it into a web application for people to play around with. 

I will also likely make small bug fixes or optimizations, but this is a side project and I will not be devoting a large amount of attention to it.
